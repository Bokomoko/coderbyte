# An example of regExp to ease coding

## The following example was created to solve a CoderByte challenge

In this example, the problem is solved in a more procedural, conventional way spliting the strings and getting the key/values pair and also solved using regular expression, which make the code much cleaner and simpler

The API for the challenge is described in the comments inside the code.
